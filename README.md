Introduction to ICE website homework


All the files have been placed according to the code's requirements. We recommend using Firefox due to Chrome having
permission issues with the Home Page's "cover" caroussel and the gallery's javascript.

For the homepage we wanted to add to Facebook by adding news to the home page. We would prefer a Facebook with news
integrated. This is because most of the population is on social media, and if we would like media awareness social
media is the way to go. Other than that our albums on the home page span on cover making viewing images easy and fast.

The gallery page conists of pictures that when you hover will appear on the big picture portion of the screen.

A feature which we are proud to present is the similarities page. This page shows the similarities between you
and your friend(s). The reason for this is that many add people on Facebook without actually knowing them.
Knowing what books, movies, or music people like will allow you to actually know and become friends with these people.

Another feature is our friends page. This pages gives a short description of your friends on Facebook by the connection
you've had through Facebook. It consists of beautiful hover animations that are interesting to watch.

The last feature is AskMe. Ask.fm has become an increasingly popular website due to Facebook itself. We have seen the
growth of ask.fm and would like to integrate it into Facebook as askme. This page might be viewed as a privacy issue, but
it can be blocked to certain friends and we feel that it is a page that your friends would truely enjoy using.

Overall we went for a simple design that is soothing to the eyes so users can spend hours on it without issues. We hope 
you like an enjoy our website.
